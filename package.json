  "description": "The web application allows users to view sample quotes and add their own quotes. Users can also upvote or downvote existing quotes or delete the quotes that have been displayed.  ## Setup/Installation Requirements To use the application, users need internet access and web browsers, preferably  Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. ## Known Bugs * The web app does not highlight the quote with the highest number of upvotes. ## Behavior Driven Development (BDD) |Behavior                |Input                                           |Output                                                      | |-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------| |The landing page loads |Users scroll and click on view quote button|Users see quotes' content, creation date, and number of votes. They also see the vote and delete buttons, users click on the upvote buttton to upvote quotes, the downvote button to downvote quotes, or delete button to delete quotes| |The landing page loads|Users navigate to the form, which is on the right side of the page|Users fill the form inputs and click on the Add Quote button to add their quotes| ## Technologies Used * HTML - HTML dictates the structure of webpages. The hypertext language was used to create the form to collect users date.  * CSS & Bootstrap - CSS determines the appearance of webpages. The styling language was used to add background images and colors and style the site's content. * [Angular-Cli](https://angular.io/) - version 9.0.5. -  Angular is a TypeScript-based framework. The framework's components were used to refactor code and promote code maintenance. Inbuilt and custom directives, such as ngFor and ngIf, in turn, were used to loop through the quotes array, to determine when users could see quote details, such as date, author, and votes, to validate the form, and to add new quotes. A custom pipe was also used to calculate and display the number of days that had elapsed since each quote was added.  ## Support and contact details You are free to suggest and improve the code.
